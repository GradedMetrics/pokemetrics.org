Everything in this repository is auto-generated. The files in the top-level `docs` folder along with `docs/static` are generated from running `yarn build` in https://github.com/GradedMetrics/explorer whilst all the other subdirectories inside `docs` are SEO-related indicies generated by the API.

If you're looking to hack the UI, https://github.com/GradedMetrics/explorer is where you'll want to be.
